# TokenTool 2.0
A Token creation tool to create png images suitable for Virtual Table Tops. Now infused with Nerps!

Rewritten in JavaFX 8 to bring a modern and updated UI as well as a few new features! TokenTool 2.0 now supports PSD format for 'overlays' to allow for better masking by supporting 'layers'. To create your own 'overlay' you can use any version of PhotoShop or GIMP and add your masking layer as the first (bottom) layer and your overlay image as the second (top) layer.

New features will be added in the coming months such:
* PDF image extraction (make tokens out images from modules quick and easy!)
* Additional post processing "Effects" (like color shifting, sepia, etc)
* Image search, look for that favorite Drow image!
